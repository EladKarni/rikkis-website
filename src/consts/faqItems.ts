        question: ' What products do you use?',
        answer: `We use industry-standard face and body paints made specifically for use on skin. Some brands include Diamond FX, Tag, Starblends, and FAB. We use glitter safe for use around the eyes and mouth such as Mama Clown or Amerikan Body Art, NOT REGULAR GLITTER. Our painters carry public liabiability insurance because it's always good to be safe.`
